# Spectrofit
A GUI-based spectrum analyzing software enable users to analyze scientific data
This program uses C++ / Qt Community edition. All the interface is created by Qt Widget and GUI classes.
This program is currently under development. As it's my first C++ program with GUI, I got LOTS to learn. There is no commitment as to when an initial product will be available.

The program should contain the following features:
1. Read in a two-column data file as the spectrum
2. Generate a linear or Shirley type background by choosing two end points on the spectrum
3. Generate multiple peaks of three types (or more if available): Gaussian, Lorentzian and Sech.
4. Fit the peaks using Newtonian method
5. Display the spectrum, background, peaks and residues
6. A bunch of widges for graphically manipulating the peak shapes (Center, Width, Height, etc)
